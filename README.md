# General Jindosh Solver

Let's get that door open!

## Requirements

* Python 2.7
* some philosophical desperation

## Output

    > ./jindosh.py
    Found 1 solution(s):
    
    Solution 1:
    
    Baroness Finch  : Bird Pendant
    Countess Contee : Ring
    Doctor Marcolla : Diamond
    Lady Winslow    : Snuff Tin
    Madam Natsiou   : War Medal
    
## The things which are not

* could be easily adapted to read riddle conditions from a file
* the order of the attributes in the riddle is random, but once you have a single solution, it's trivial to just map the attribute order of any other riddle instance
* I'm still a fan of the save/read/load/open/achieve method
* yeah, it's kind of an overkill
